## About RealworldStateTest

This project is an implementation follow Realworld open source spec, this spec is followed by many developers internationally. The project purpose is to show how a real application is built, deployed using many different tech stack. From doing this project, I learnt a lot about Angular, State Management, Backend .Net Trick, Deployment using Azure Container Registry, Azure App Service, Deploy to GitHub Pages, Vercel.\
Moreover, I got chances to read many open-source code of my favorite tech stack and have opportunity to hone my skill further. But for now, I haven't have intention to push my code to the CodeBaseShow of the Realworld Project but I may do that in the future when I have more confidence.
